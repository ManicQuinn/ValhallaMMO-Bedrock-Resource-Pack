# ValhallaMMO-Bedrock-Resource-Pack
A Bedrock Resource Pack designed for the Beta version of the ValhallaMMO Plugin to work alongside Geyser.

Instructions:
1. Get the GeyserOptionalPack.mcpack from their [Official Github](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserOptionalPack).
2. Get the "geyser_resources.mcpack" and the "geyser_mappings.json" from this repo.
3. Put the GeyserOptionalPack.mcpack and the geyser_resources.mcpack inside your "plugins/Geyser-Spigot/packs" folder.
4. Put the geyser_mappings.json in the "plugins/Geyser-Spigot/custom-mappings" folder.
5. Launch the server and when a Bedrock Client connects, it should auto download the pack.

Disclaimer: If the Bedrock client has downloaded an outdated version of this resourcepack, they need to clear it from their storage in the options. This might be in resource packs or misc depending on the platform.

This is not affiliated with ValhallaMMO in the slightest, the dev does not give Bedrock/Geyser support or compatibility, I simply loved this plugin and worked very hard to get it somewhat playable with the latest beta on my current server that I maintain for my one Bedrock player(Yes one, lol). Some things are broken on Bedrock edition, dual wielding for example, along with Smithing into Netherite Gear.
